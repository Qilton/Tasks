OK so just to explain how to start
1. npm run build in front end
2.node server.js at backend then it should work.
Also directly connected it to mongodb too so its saving

Now for what my api's do:
1.Get is to get all the information at the start you can see in frontend that im calling the todos from backend
2.Post is to add the todos. I am adding to the backend and also to the frontend Todos.
3.Delete is to delete the todos.
4.Put is for the checkbox(to mark that the todo is finished)
